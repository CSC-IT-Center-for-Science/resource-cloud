Current situation, a properly created image is started without problems in Pebbles. Usually, the image has to be customized for a certain purpose, that is how geopebbles machines are created. It has been tested at least with this workflow:
- Create VM in cPouta from an existing image and with option Boot from image (most likely Boot from snapshot also works). To be confirm in explicit tests: It will fail if image is created by launching instance with options: Boot from volume, Boot from image (creates a new volume), Boot from volume snapshot (creates a new volume)
- Modify the VM as needed
- Create an image from the VM (to be tested, if you create an snapshot it might also work)
- Images are created with RAW format, which takes as much disk space as the VM disk, for ex 80Gb. To save space, transform it to QCOW2 for ex using openstack python CLI and qemu tools.
- Upload the compressed image to the Pebbles cPouta project or share the image to the project (usually the image is created in the user's project)
- The image is  then added to the Pebbles (by and Admin) by adding a template via the Configure menu. This way the image is available to create blueprints in Pebbles. https://193.166.25.91/#/configure
- Next, create a blue print via the Blueprint menu and activate it (https://193.166.25.91/#/blueprints) 
- Finally the users can start an instance from the Dashboard (as an Admin you have more menu items, in the Dashboard vies you can set the "view as user" to see what final users see).
- Current test image is created as per instructions in: Pouta-bp-osgeolive11-CSC-Anas postgis.sh
- Client starts instance from GeoPebbles:
	- instance starts up in less than 1 min
